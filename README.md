the pages file has all the streamlit python files
test data is separate data hidden from model
old data is from older versions where I consider using auckland aero and whenuapai weather stations, but the time scale for the data was too off so I didn't use it
auckland_rain_map.html is the map where the rain intensity is shown over time across four stations.
