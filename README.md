the pages file has all the streamlit python files
test data is separate data hidden from model
old data is from older versions where I consider using auckland aero and whenuapai weather stations, but the time scale for the data was too off so I didn't use it
auckland_rain_map.html is the map where the rain intensity is shown over time across four stations.  

also the streamlit works fine on your own computer, but hosting it online can cause a lot of performance issues, especially if you move too fast with the app e.g. trying to click stuff before it loads in fully or while the ML models are runnning.
